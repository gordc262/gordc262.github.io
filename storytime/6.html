When Zeus, the loud-thunderer, the one who sees far and wide, heard this, he sent to Hadês the one with the golden wand, the Argos-killer Hermes so that he may persuade Hadês, with gentle words, that he allow holy Persephone to leave the misty realms of darkness and be brought up to the light in order to join the the gods in Olympus, so that her mother may see her with her own eyes and then let go of her anger.

Going near Hadês and stopping, Hermes said to him:
<br><br><br>
            
“Hadês! Dark-haired one! King of the dead! Zeus the Father orders that I have splendid Persephone brought back up to light from Erebos back to him and his company, so that her mother may see her with her own eyes and let go of her wrath and terrible mênis against the immortals.”
</p>
<br><br><br><br>

  Hadês, King of the Dead, smiled, and he did not disobey the order of Zeus the King. Swiftly he gave an order to bright-minded Persephone.
