  And the Lady Mother Demeter heard her. And a sharp akhos seized her heart. 

  <br><br><br>

  The headband on her hair she tore off with her own immortal hands and threw a dark cloak over her shoulders.
</p>

 <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br>
  <br><br><br>

 <p class="right">
 She sped off like a bird, soaring over land and sea, looking and looking. 
 <br> <br>
 But no one was willing to tell her the truth, not one of the gods, not one of the mortal humans, not one of the birds, messengers of the truth.
  <br><br> <br>
Thereafter, for nine days did the Lady Demeter wander all over the earth, holding torches ablaze in her hands.  </p>

 <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="left">
She came then to Hêlios, the seeing-eye of gods and men.
<br><br>
  She stood in front of his chariot-team, and the resplendent goddess asked this question:
</p>

<br><br>

<p class="right">
  “Helios!
<br><br><br>
  Show me respect, god to goddess, It is about the girl born to me, a sweet young seedling, renowned for her beauty,
  <br>
   whose piercing cry I heard resounding through the boundless aether,
   <br><br>
   Tell me without error whether you have by any chance seen my child,
   <br>
   and who has taken her away from me by force, against her will, and then gone away?”
</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
 <p class='left'> 
So she spoke. 
<br> <br>
And the son of Hyperion answered her with these words:
<br><br><br>
“Daughter of Rhea with the beautiful hair, Queen Demeter! You shall know the answer, for I greatly respect you and feel sorry for you. No one else among all the immortals is responsible except the cloud-gatherer Zeus himself, who gave her to Hadês as his beautiful wife."

</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="right">
  And Demeter was visited by akhos that was even more terrible than before.
