   “Go, Persephone, to your mother, the one with the dark robe. Have a kindly disposition and thûmos in your breast. Do not be too upset, excessively so.”
   <br><br>
So he spoke. 
 </p>

 <br><br><br>

   And high-minded Persephone rejoiced. Swiftly she set out, with joy. 
   <br><br>But Hadês gave her, stealthily, the honey-sweet berry of the pomegranate to eat, for he did not want her to stay for all time over there, at the side of her honorable mother, the one with the dark robe.

 <br><br><br>

  Swiftly they made their way along the long journey.
  <br><br> Hermes came to a halt at the place where Demeter, with the beautiful garlands in the hair, was staying, at the forefront of the temple fragrant with incense. 
  <br><br>
  When Demeter saw them, she rushed forth like a maenad down a wooded mountain slope.

  Demeter was answered by Persephone, the most beautiful:
  <br><br><br>
   “So then, Mother, I shall tell you everything, without error.
   <br> When the messenger came to me, the swift Argos-killer, with the news from my father, the son of Kronos, and from the other dwellers in the sky, that I should come from Erebos, so that you may see me with your own eyes and let go of your wrath and terrible mênis against the immortals, then I sprang up for joy, 
   <br><br>but he, stealthily, put into my hand the berry of the pomegranate, that honey-sweet food, and he compelled me by biâ to eat of it.”
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="right">
This happened the moment Rhea arrived from the boundless aether. Rhea, the one with the splendid headband, addressed Demeter:
<br><br><br>
“Come, child, Zeus the loud-thunderer, the one who sees far and wide, is summoning you to come to the company of that special group of gods. 
<br><br>Zeus assented that your daughter, every time the season comes round, would spend a third portion of the year in the realms of dark mist underneath, and the other two thirds in your company and that of the other immortals.”
<br><br><br>
So she spoke.
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="left">
  And Demeter, she with the beautiful garlands in her hair, did not disobey.
  <br><br>
  Straightaway she sent up the harvest from the land with its rich clods of earth. And all the wide earth with leaves and blossoms was laden.
