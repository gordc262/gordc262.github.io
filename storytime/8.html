And when the resplendent goddess finished, Demeter and Persephone went to Olympus, to join the company of the other gods.
<br><br><br>
And there they abide at the side of Zeus, who delights in the thunderbolt. Holy they are, and revered. 
<br><br><br>
But come, you goddesses, who have charge of the dêmos of Eleusis, fragrant with incense. and of Paros the island and rocky Antron.
<br><br><br>
Come, O lady resplendent with gifts, queen Dêô, bringer of hôrai, both you and your daughter, the most beautiful Persephone. 
<br><br><br>
Think kindly and grant, in return for this song, a rich means of livelihood that suits the thûmos. And I will keep you in mind throughout the rest of my song.
