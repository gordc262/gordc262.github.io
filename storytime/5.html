  She made that year the most terrible one for mortals, all over the Earth, the nurturer of many. 
  <br><br>
  The Earth did not send up any seed. Demeter, she with the beautiful garlands in her hair, kept them covered underground. 
  <br><br>
  Many a curved plough was dragged along the fields by many an ox—all in vain. Many a bright grain of wheat fell into the earth—all for naught.

At this moment, Demeter could have destroyed the entire race of humans with harsh hunger,
if Zeus had not noticed with his noos, taking note in his thûmos.
<br><br><br><br>
First, he sent Iris, with the golden wings, to summon Demeter with the splendid hair. And she obeyed Zeus, the one with the dark clouds, the son of Kronos, and she ran the space between sky and earth quickly with her feet.

<br> <br><br><br>

 She arrived at the city of Eleusis, fragrant with incense, and she found in the temple Demeter, the one with the dark robe.
<br><br><br>
Addressing her, she spoke winged words:

<br><br>

<p class="right">
“Demeter! 
<br><br>
Zeus, the one who has unwilting knowledge, summons you to come to the company of the immortal gods. So then, come! 
<br><br>
May what my words say, which come from Zeus, not fail to be turned into action that is completed.”
</p>

<br> <br><br><br>

But no one could persuade her in her thinking or in her intention, angry as she was in her thûmos, and she harshly said no to their words.
<br><br><br>
She said that she would never go to fragrant Olympus, that she would never send up the harvest of the earth, until she saw with her own eyes her daughter, the one with the beautiful looks.
