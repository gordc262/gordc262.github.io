<p class="left">
  I begin to sing of Demeter, the holy goddess with the beautiful hair.
  <br><br><br>
  And her daughter Persephone too. The one with the delicate ankles, whom Hadês seized.
</p>

<br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br>

<p class="right field">
  She was picking flowers: roses, crocus, and beautiful violets.
  <br><br> <br>
  Up and down the soft meadow. 
  <br><br><br>
  Iris blossoms too she picked, and hyacinth. And the narcissus, which was grown as a lure for the flower-faced girl by Gaia.
</p>

<p class="right flower">
  She was filled with a sense of wonder, and she reached out with both hands to take hold of the pretty plaything. 
</p> 

<br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="left hole">
  And the earth, full of roads leading every which way, opened up under her.
  <br><br><br>
  There it was that the Lord who receives many guests made his lunge.
  <br><br><br>
  The son of Kronos. The one known by many names. 
  <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br>
  He seized her against her will, put her on his golden chariot, and drove away as she wept.
</p>

<br><br> <br><br><br><br>

<p class="left">
  And the Lady Mother Demeter heard her. And a sharp akhos seized her heart. 

  <br><br><br>

  The headband on her hair she tore off with her own immortal hands and threw a dark cloak over her shoulders.
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="right">
  She sped off like a bird, soaring over land and sea, looking and looking. 
  <br> <br>
  But no one was willing to tell her the truth, not one of the gods, not one of the mortal humans, not one of the birds, messengers of the truth.
  <br><br> <br>
  Thereafter, for nine days did the Lady Demeter wander all over the earth, holding torches ablaze in her hands.  
</p>

<br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="left">
  She came then to Hêlios, the seeing-eye of gods and men.
  <br><br>
  She stood in front of his chariot-team, and the resplendent goddess asked this question:
</p>

<br><br>

<p class="right">
  “Helios!
  <br><br><br>
  Show me respect, god to goddess, It is about the girl born to me, a sweet young seedling, renowned for her beauty,
  <br>
  whose piercing cry I heard resounding through the boundless aether,
  <br><br>
  Tell me without error whether you have by any chance seen my child,
  <br>
  and who has taken her away from me by force, against her will, and then gone away?”
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p class='left'> 
  So she spoke. 
  <br> <br>
  And the son of Hyperion answered her with these words:
  <br><br><br>
  “Daughter of Rhea with the beautiful hair, Queen Demeter! You shall know the answer, for I greatly respect you and feel sorry for you. No one else among all the immortals is responsible except the cloud-gatherer Zeus himself, who gave her to Hadês as his beautiful wife."
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="right">
  And Demeter was visited by akhos that was even more terrible than before.
</p>

<br><br><br>

<p class="left dead">
  She made that year the most terrible one for mortals, all over the Earth, the nurturer of many. 
  <br><br>
  The Earth did not send up any seed. Demeter, she with the beautiful garlands in her hair, kept them covered underground. 
  <br><br>
  Many a curved plough was dragged along the fields by many an ox—all in vain. Many a bright grain of wheat fell into the earth—all for naught.
</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p class="right rainbow">
  At this moment, Demeter could have destroyed the entire race of humans with harsh hunger,
  if Zeus had not noticed with his noos, taking note in his thûmos.
  <br><br><br><br>
  First, he sent Iris, the Rainbow, with the golden wings, to summon Demeter with the splendid hair. And she obeyed Zeus, the one with the dark clouds, the son of Kronos, and she ran the space between sky and earth quickly with her feet.
</p>

<br> <br><br><br>

<p class="left temple">
  She arrived at the city of Eleusis, fragrant with incense, and she found in the temple Demeter, the one with the dark robe.
  <br><br><br>
  Addressing her, she spoke winged words:
</p>

<br><br>

<p class="right">
  “Demeter! 
  <br><br>
  Zeus, the one who has unwilting knowledge, summons you to come to the company of the immortal gods. So then, come! 
  <br><br>
  May what my words say, which come from Zeus, not fail to be turned into action that is completed.”
</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p class="left">
  But no one could persuade her in her thinking or in her intention, angry as she was in her thûmos, and she harshly said no to their words.
  <br><br><br>
  She said that she would never go to fragrant Olympus, that she would never send up the harvest of the earth, until she saw with her own eyes her daughter, the one with the beautiful looks.
</p>

<br><br><br>

<p class="right">
  When Zeus, the loud-thunderer, the one who sees far and wide, heard this, he sent to Hadês the one with the golden wand, the Argos-killer Hermes so that he may persuade Hadês, with gentle words, that he allow holy Persephone to leave the misty realms of darkness and be brought up to the light in order to join the the gods in Olympus, so that her mother may see her with her own eyes and then let go of her anger.
</p>

<br><br>

<p class="left"> 
  Going near Hadês and stopping, Hermes said to him:
  <br><br><br>         
  “Hadês! Dark-haired one! King of the dead! Zeus the Father orders that I have splendid Persephone brought back up to light from Erebos back to him and his company, so that her mother may see her with her own eyes and let go of her wrath and terrible mênis against the immortals.”
</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p class="right">
  Hadês, King of the Dead, smiled, and he did not disobey the order of Zeus the King. Swiftly he gave an order to bright-minded Persephone.
</p>

<br><br><br>

<p class="left">
  “Go, Persephone, to your mother, the one with the dark robe. Have a kindly disposition and thûmos in your breast. Do not be too upset, excessively so.”
  <br><br>
  So he spoke. 
 </p>

 <br><br><br>

 <p class="right">
   And high-minded Persephone rejoiced. Swiftly she set out, with joy. 
   <br><br>
   But Hadês gave her, stealthily, the honey-sweet berry of the pomegranate to eat, for he did not want her to stay for all time over there, at the side of her honorable mother, the one with the dark robe.
 </p>


 <br><br><br>

 <p class="left">
  Swiftly they made their way along the long journey.
  <br><br> 
  Hermes came to a halt at the place where Demeter, with the beautiful garlands in the hair, was staying, at the forefront of the temple fragrant with incense. 
  <br><br>
  When Demeter saw them, she rushed forth like a maenad down a wooded mountain slope.
 </p>

<p><img id="tear" src="images/tear.png" width="100%" height="auto"></p>

<p class="left">
  Demeter was answered by Persephone, the most beautiful:
  <br><br><br>
  “So then, Mother, I shall tell you everything, without error.
  <br> When the messenger came to me, the swift Argos-killer, with the news from my father, the son of Kronos, and from the other dwellers in the sky, that I should come from Erebos, so that you may see me with your own eyes and let go of your wrath and terrible mênis against the immortals, then I sprang up for joy, 
  <br><br>
  but he, stealthily, put into my hand the berry of the pomegranate, that honey-sweet food, and he compelled me by biâ to eat of it.”
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="right">
  This happened the moment Rhea arrived from the boundless aether. Rhea, the one with the splendid headband, addressed Demeter:
  <br><br><br>
  “Come, child, Zeus the loud-thunderer, the one who sees far and wide, is summoning you to come to the company of that special group of gods. 
  <br><br>
  Zeus assented that your daughter, every time the season comes round, would spend a third portion of the year in the realms of dark mist underneath, and the other two thirds in your company and that of the other immortals.”
  <br><br><br>
  So she spoke.
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p class="left">
  And Demeter, she with the beautiful garlands in her hair, did not disobey.
  <br><br>
  Straightaway she sent up the harvest from the land with its rich clods of earth. And all the wide earth with leaves and blossoms was laden.
</p>

  <br><br><br>

<p class="center">
  And when the resplendent goddess finished, Demeter and Persephone went to Olympus, to join the company of the other gods.
  <br><br><br>
  And there they abide at the side of Zeus, who delights in the thunderbolt. Holy they are, and revered. 
  <br><br><br>
  But come, you goddesses, who have charge of the dêmos of Eleusis, fragrant with incense. and of Paros the island and rocky Antron.
  <br><br><br>
  Come, O lady resplendent with gifts, queen Dêô, bringer of hôrai, both you and your daughter, the most beautiful Persephone. 
  <br><br><br>
  Think kindly and grant, in return for this song, a rich means of livelihood that suits the thûmos. And I will keep you in mind throughout the rest of my song.
