  I begin to sing of Demeter, the holy goddess with the beautiful hair. 
  </p>

  <br><br><br>
<p class="left">
  And her daughter Persephone too. The one with the delicate ankles, whom HadÃªs seized.
</p>

  She was picking flowers: roses, crocus, and beautiful violets.</p>
  <br><br> <br>
 <p class="right"> Up and down the soft meadow. </p>

<p class="left">
And the earth, full of roads leading every which way, opened up under her.
