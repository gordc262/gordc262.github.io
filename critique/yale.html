<p>Yale School of Art's website is an expiremental website that changes depending on when you are looking at it. The concept is that any student or faculty of Yale School of art can change some of the site's content.</p>

<p>The website is definitely chaotic and looks almost like an early website with its repeating animated backgound images and very basic-looking elements. The home page almost looks like a blog with recent announcements. The navigation links on the left side each lead to a different page (with a different animated background). Each page holds a lot of information in the form of blocks of text that are difficult to scan.</p>

<p>Although Yale School of Art's website is interesting and has a definite aesthetic, it makes it difficult for people who aren't familiar with it to naviagate and find information. Prospective students might be confused by pages changing between visits. Universities create a first impression through websites, and a student who doesn't know much about Yale School of Art might be intimidated or put off by this website.</p>
