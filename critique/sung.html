<p>Alfred Sung is the website for the Canadian fashion designer, Alfred Sung. This website is an example of web design that looks good, but has a confusing user experience.</p>

<p>Upon first appearances, the Alfred Sung website looks simple and elegant. However, there are no elements to click on. The user has to move their cursor blindly until they hover over the left side of the screen, displaying the navigation menu. Clicking on any of these links brings the user to a new page within that category. They then have to click through every category to get to a specific product, rather than an array of products on one page.</p>

<p>Once the user is inside the menus, the website gives no indication on how you return. Even if you press the back button, the same menu shows up. The user has to figure out on their own that in order to return to previous menus, you have to click on the "leaflets" that stick out.</p>

<p>The Alfred Sung website looks great for a luxury designer, but it could make a user who didn't know how to navigate the site frustrated. The navigation is unusual and nothing indicates what the user is supposed to do.</p>
