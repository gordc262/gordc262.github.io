<p>Candy Stripper is a Japanese fashion brand. Their website is an example of simple web design that conveys the brand's aesthetic and concept.</p>

<p class="left">In the site's header, there's a small, almost unnoticeable image of a panda. When you hover over the panda, a small menu of colors pops up. When you click one of these colors, the navigation items all change to that color. This adds a little playfulness to the website that isn't overwhelming or annoying. There's nothing to indicate that you should click on these colors; it's up to the user to explore and find out on their own.</p>

<div class="right"><img src="images/panda.png"></div>

<p>Most of the site's navigation elements are just links, except for the "Online Store" and "Blog" buttons, which reveal drop down menus on hover. </p>

<p>The main feature of the front page is a slideshow. The image in the slide show changes opacity on hover. There's a small menu beneath it which indicates which slide is showing and allows users to click on a specific slide.</p>
