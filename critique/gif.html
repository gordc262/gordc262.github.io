<p>Gifme is a website for the Sketch plugin Gifme that allows you to put .gifs into Sketch.</p>

<p>The Gifme website is obviously designed to evoke the idea of early computing technology, with a flashing underscore symbol at the end of sections of text like a command line, the blue background and white text of a Windows blue error screen, a pixelated cursor, and an image of an old computer.</p>

<p>The aim of this website is simply to give users a place to download the plugin and generally explain how it works. The download button is in plain view at the beginning, as well as in a fixed element that allows the user to download easily even if they scroll past the first button. There is also a third download button when the user reaches the bottom of the page, beneath the reviews.</p>

<p>As the user scrolls down, elements appear that explain how to download and use the plugin. There is a simple text explanation, as well as a .gif demonstrating the process, which has the added benefit of giving the user and example of how they can use a .gif in a web page.</p>

<p>Beneath this, there is a small section that displays two reviews. These appear to be tweets, but are not clickable and don't have a source attached in any way. Then, at the bottom, the creators are displayed as subtle clickable images that lead to their website.</p>
