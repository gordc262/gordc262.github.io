<p>The Afterlife is a website hosted by the Internet Archaeology project. It is a single page with no links or text. Instead, it utilizes hundreds of images and .gifs to create a moving collage. Each image is within a div and each div has a unique ID, which is used to animate the elements in CSS so they move down the screen. </p>

<p>The website uses the embed element to automatically download a .midi file, obviously intended to be listened to while vieweing the site. Although this was once a more common feature, today it is basically unheard of. It makes the user anxious to get a file that they didn't download on purpose, thinking it might be malicious. It's also annoying if you refresh the page several times and end up with several copies of the file in your downloads.</p>

<p>Although The Afterlife is dated and chaotic, it functions less as a useable web interface and more as a piece of art. The Afterlife is a fun and engaging example of what a website can be if you dispense of all your expectations of what a modern website should be like.</p>
